## F.A.Q  

- Will there be a Forge version?
   - I will not be developing a Forge version of this mod, however,   
     you are free to convert the mod to Forge yourself.  
     
       
- When is the next update?
    - Updates are released when I feel the new content is stable and polished enough for release.  
    
    
- Can you add X feature?
    - Suggestions are always welcome. To make a suggestion, open an issue on the github page.  
      This makes it easy to track all open suggestions.  
        

- Can I include this in modpacks?
    - Yes. Linking to this page is not required, but is always appreciated.  
 
    
- The game warns me about experimental world settings. 
    - There is nothing I can do about this. Most of the world generation additions in this mod are done via datapack.  
      This is a warning Mojang added to the game. The world generation additions in this mod have been tested and no major issues have been found.  
      You can use [Disable Custom Worlds Advice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-disable-custom-worlds-advice) to remove this warning if you wish.
